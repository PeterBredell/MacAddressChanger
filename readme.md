# MAC Address Changer

This project is a tool designed to allow users to change the MAC address of their network interface cards (NICs). It provides a simple and efficient way to anonymize your network identity or troubleshoot network-related issues.

## Features
- Change the MAC address of physical NICs.
- Restore the original MAC address when needed.
- User-friendly interface for seamless operation.

## Requirements
- Operating System: Windows
- Administrator privileges for modifying network configurations.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/MacAddressChanger.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd MacAddressChanger
    ```
3. Follow the platform-specific setup instructions in the documentation.

## Usage
1. Run the application with appropriate permissions.
2. Select the NIC you want to modify.
3. Enter the desired MAC address or generate a random one.
4. Apply the changes.

## Future Plans
We aim to expand the functionality of this project by incorporating the following features:
- **Virtual NIC Support**: 
  - Create custom virtual NICs with unique MAC addresses.
  - Tunnel network traffic through these virtual NICs for enhanced privacy and control.
  - Ensure continued usability even if support for physical NIC modifications is deprecated.
- **C++ Version**: A faster, more efficient version of the tool written in C++ is under development.
- **Packaged GUI Version**: A user-friendly graphical interface will be introduced for easier operation.

Stay tuned for updates as we work towards implementing these features!
